- Build refs go to `libs/` inside project folder; they are gitignored. Get valid refs with https://github.com/Reinms/Stubber-Publicizer.
- Main plugin class: `RegionKitMod.cs`. Please avoid clutter there and only add initialization calls; add your stuff to separate classes and/or sub-namespaces.
- `Utils/` has some boilerplate methods for reflection / unity primitives conversion etc. Take a peek there if you feel like you're living a ground hog day (or if you'd want to save someone from that feeling in the future)
